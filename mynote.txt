frontend's route is url. When I click the link holding a certain URL,
it means that i touch the params. 
The params is related to body.params.id which is used in backend.
The moment i click the link that hold the url, I sent/touch/requested
 the params, which is body.params


 tell apart!!req.params vs. req.query vs. req.body
 req.params: contains url parameters defined in the route path.
 req.query:contains query string parameters from url.
 req.body: contains data sent in the body of the request, 
 typically used in  POST, PUT or PATCH request


 If next.js is used, don't have to use useState etc..

 react-redux is a kind of bridge to connect react and redux together
 redux can be used without react. it can be used with angular/vue etc.


 redux . surround main router with it
